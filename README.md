This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The game can be accessed at: https://utmichael.github.io/lottery-react-app/

The smart contract can be access at: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xebf40311f2b6237b68139a2d2396f84c2c131671

The project used smart contract deployed on ROPSTEN Network:
It will take two prompts: select from A to D, making a combination to AA to DD. 
The smart contract will generate two random letters from A to D. If the player has a matched letter,
the pot goes to the player. Otherwise the pot stays in the pool. 

The chance of winning is 1/16. Since the random number is generated everytime player buying the ticket, 
it will be case independent.
